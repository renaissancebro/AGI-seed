# AGI-seed

In my search for understanding myself and improving i've seen how I am different, and hope to use this as a way to benefit tools and creation potential. I want to create what I am making, an emotional seed in AI in order to introduce safer systems and more traceable origins. This is something I can do, I know it, and I'm going to even if the world says I can't or treated me like I couldn't.
