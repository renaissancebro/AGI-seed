# AGI-Seed

AGI-Seed is my starting point toward building emotionally grounded AI systems. It stems from a personal need: to understand myself and translate that awareness into tools that can make AI safer, more human-aligned, and harder to misuse.

This is a project about embedding emotional primitives — like uncertainty, shame, pride, and empathy — into models using realistic human-scale psychology. My belief is simple: if we can't model meaning and emotional behavior, we're building powerful tools blind to the real structure of human experience.

This repository implements sophisticated psychological systems including gravitational identity formation, emotion templates, and advanced shame mechanisms for authentic AI emotional expression.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Try the uncertainty agent:

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/renaissancebro/AGI-seed.git
cd AGI-seed
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add your OpenAI API key to .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env

# Run demonstrations
python examples/demo_questions.py
```

## 🧠 Emotional Framework

This repository implements **emotions as computational primitives** using physics-based metaphors:

### Currently Implemented
- **[Uncertainty as Osmosis](notes/uncertainty.md)** - Pressure gradients driving decision-making and verbal hesitation
- **Working Agent**: `agents/uncertainty_agent.py` demonstrates real-time uncertainty detection and behavioral modification

### Theoretical Framework
- **Identity as Gravity** - Core beliefs resist change, new ideas need activation energy
- **Trauma as Nuclear Decay** - Emotional healing follows exponential half-life patterns
- **More emotions in development...**

## Vision

- Introduce emotional grounding into AI models starting with uncertainty.
- Explore how emotional embedding can increase alignment, deterrence, and interpretability.
- Make emotional behavior a measurable component in model outputs — not just a side effect.
