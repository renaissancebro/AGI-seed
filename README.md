# AGI-Seed

AGI-Seed is my starting point toward building emotionally grounded AI systems. It stems from a personal need: to understand myself and translate that awareness into tools that can make AI safer, more human-aligned, and harder to misuse.

This is a project about embedding emotional primitives — like uncertainty, shame, pride, and empathy — into models using realistic human-scale psychology. My belief is simple: if we can't model meaning and emotional behavior, we're building powerful tools blind to the real structure of human experience.

This repository implements sophisticated psychological systems including gravitational identity formation, emotion templates, and advanced shame mechanisms for authentic AI emotional expression.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/renaissancebro/AGI-seed.git
cd AGI-seed
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add your OpenAI API key to .env file (optional for core systems)
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env

# Try the psychological systems
python examples/demo_identity.py --model    # Identity & emotion templates
python examples/demo_shame.py              # Advanced shame mechanism
python examples/demo_questions.py          # Uncertainty agent (needs API key)
```

## 🧠 Psychological Systems

This repository implements **emotions as computational primitives** using physics-based metaphors and realistic human-scale psychology:

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- **[Identity as Gravitational Physics](examples/docs/identity.md)** - Beliefs create mass, experiences cause gravitational resistance to change
  - Loss aversion, elastic resilience, trauma thresholds, realistic scaling
- **[Advanced Shame Mechanism](examples/docs/shame.md)** - Violations of internalized standards trigger shame
  - Semantic dissonance, social exposure amplification, belief damage
- **[Emotion Templates](examples/docs/emotions.md)** - Fear, shame, comfort, pride, loneliness detection framework
- **[Uncertainty as AI Measurement](examples/docs/uncertainty.md)** - Response variance driving decision confidence

### 🧪 Integration Framework
- **Modular Architecture** - `psychological_systems/` with identity, emotions, uncertainty modules
- **Unified Agents** - Framework ready for combining multiple psychological primitives
- **Realistic Psychology** - Human-scale experience weighting, diminishing returns, recovery patterns

## Vision

- Introduce emotional grounding into AI models starting with uncertainty.
- Explore how emotional embedding can increase alignment, deterrence, and interpretability.
- Make emotional behavior a measurable component in model outputs — not just a side effect.
