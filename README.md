# AGI-Seed

AGI-Seed is my starting point toward building emotionally grounded AI systems. It stems from a personal need: to understand myself and translate that awareness into tools that can make AI safer, more human-aligned, and harder to misuse.

This is a project about embedding emotional primitives — like uncertainty, guilt, and empathy — into models. My belief is simple: if we can’t model meaning and emotional behavior, we’re building powerful tools blind to the real structure of human experience.

This repository is the beginning, for a more transparent AI decision making process.

## Vision

- Introduce emotional grounding into AI models starting with uncertainty.
- Explore how emotional embedding can increase alignment, deterrence, and interpretability.
- Make emotional behavior a measurable component in model outputs — not just a side effect.
