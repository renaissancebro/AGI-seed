# 🛡️ Uncertainty Model Robustness Roadmap

## ✅ Current Implementation

### Semantic Similarity Scoring
- **Embedding-based uncertainty** using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002
- **Cosine similarity** between response embeddings  
- **Fallback to hash method** if embedding API fails
- **Method selection** via parameter: `score_variance(outputs, method="similarity")`

### Benefits Over Hash Method
- Understands semantic equivalence ("4" vs "four" vs "2+2=4")
- More robust to formatting differences
- Better captures genuine disagreement vs. stylistic variation

## 🎯 Short-term Improvements (2-4 weeks)

### 1. **Calibration & Validation**
- [ ] Create test dataset with known uncertainty levels
- [ ] Measure correlation between uncertainty scores and actual accuracy
- [ ] Tune similarity thresholds based on real performance data
- [ ] A/B test hash vs similarity methods on various question types

### 2. **Statistical Robustness** 
- [ ] Increase sample size from 3 to 5-7 responses
- [ ] Add confidence intervals around uncertainty scores
- [ ] Implement statistical significance testing for variance
- [ ] Add outlier detection to filter low-quality responses

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
- [ ] Batch embedding API calls to reduce latency
- [ ] Cache embeddings for repeated phrases
- [ ] Implement async processing for faster response times
- [ ] Add timeout handling for embedding failures

## 🚀 Medium-term Enhancements (1-3 months)

### 4. **Multi-Modal Uncertainty Detection**
- [ ] **Self-consistency checking**: "Do these answers contradict each other?"
- [ ] **Confidence extraction**: Parse explicit confidence statements from responses
- [ ] **Question-type adaptation**: Different thresholds for factual vs. subjective questions
- [ ] **Context awareness**: Adjust uncertainty based on question complexity

### 5. **Advanced Scoring Methods**
- [ ] **Token-level logit analysis** (if API provides logprobs)
- [ ] **Ensemble disagreement** using different models/temperatures
- [ ] **Information-theoretic measures** (mutual information, KL divergence)
- [ ] **Semantic entailment** checking between responses

### 6. **Behavioral Integration**
- [ ] **Memory integration**: Learn from past uncertainty patterns
- [ ] **User feedback loops**: Adjust based on user corrections
- [ ] **Domain-specific calibration**: Different uncertainty models per topic
- [ ] **Temporal awareness**: Uncertainty changes over conversation context

## 🔬 Long-term Research Directions (3+ months)

### 7. **Epistemic vs. Aleatoric Uncertainty**
- [ ] Distinguish between model uncertainty (epistemic) and inherent randomness (aleatoric)
- [ ] Develop separate scoring for "I don't know" vs. "This is inherently uncertain"
- [ ] Create uncertainty attribution ("uncertain because of conflicting sources")

### 8. **Metacognitive Modeling**
- [ ] **Uncertainty about uncertainty**: How confident is the model in its uncertainty estimate?
- [ ] **Learning curves**: Track how uncertainty changes as the model learns
- [ ] **Error prediction**: Predict when the model is likely to be wrong

### 9. **Human-AI Uncertainty Alignment**
- [ ] Study how human uncertainty correlates with model uncertainty
- [ ] Design uncertainty communication that matches human intuitions
- [ ] Build trust through well-calibrated uncertainty expression

---

## 📊 Evaluation Framework

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] **Benchmark datasets** with ground truth uncertainty labels
- [ ] **Human evaluation** of uncertainty appropriateness
- [ ] **Cross-domain testing** (science, creative writing, math, etc.)
- [ ] **Adversarial testing** with deliberately confusing questions

### Metrics
- [ ] **Calibration plots**: Uncertainty score vs. actual accuracy
- [ ] **Discrimination ability**: Can uncertainty distinguish correct vs. incorrect?
- [ ] **User satisfaction**: Do uncertainty qualifiers improve user experience?
- [ ] **Computational cost**: Latency and API cost analysis
